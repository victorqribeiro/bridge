## Rules

The farmer is the only one who can pilot the boat. The boat only carries two at a time. The goat can never be left alone with the cabbage, or it will devour it. The wolf also cannot be left alone with the goat, or it will eat it too. Can you cross them all?

## How to play

Click on the farmer, wolf, goat or cabbage to enter or leave the boat. Click the boat to cross the river - it'll only do it if the farmer is inside.
